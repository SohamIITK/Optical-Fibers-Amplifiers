# Optical-Fibers-Amplifiers
This repo has some small codes that I wrote to make some calculations related to Optical Fibers and Amplifiers. Atleast you can cross check your calculations using them.


## Planar-Waveguides
This folder contains a python code that will calculate values of allowed angles of incidence and mode propagation constants for each value of 'm'. As of now, only manual pen-paper work needed is the calculation for maximum allowed angle.
